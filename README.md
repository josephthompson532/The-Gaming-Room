## The Gaming Room
The client, The Gaming Room, would like to expand an existing application, Draw It Or Lose It, which is currently only avialable on Android, to be available as a web-based application. This application must be capable of hosting games with one or more teams each consisting of one or more uniquely named players. Furthermore, only one game may exist in memory at any given time. The software the client asked me to implement is a client-server model. This is the standard model for hosting games of this sort. 

In developing this documentation I think I did a particularly good job at identifying the hardware requirements. Often the area with most options in terms of implementation is memory and storage. As such, there is a lot to consider when determining which is the most fitting solution for any given scenario. 

When writing code, it is easy to lose sight of the bigger picture while you are wading through syntax. The design document helped me to clearly delineate the software I was coding. I had created a sort of 3d map in my brain of design constraints, requirements, and plans for implementation that I needed only put into code.

I would revise my design constraints. I feel I could have put more thought into this. For me the design constraints, and executive summary seemed very similar so it was hard for me to clearly determine what information should go where. To improve this section, I would view other examples of executive summaries and design constraints to get a better feel for them.

Ultimately the project is not for the developers but the Users. As such, it is important to not get too caught up in other things and forget to consider the Users experience. 

To design a similar application in the future I would make sure to do a lot of work before ever writing any code. I would first make a software design template. Then, I would spend time creating UML diagrams to document how the application is going to function. Only after taking these steps would I write my code, which would be well-documented and have many inline comments to make it clear what the code is doing.
